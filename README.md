# Spring-Thymeleaf_checkboxes_and_radiobuttons

In this app you can add a risk and select several checkboxes, a radio button option and a drop down menu option per each risk being added. Later you can click at Edit to see initial selections restored (depending on which risk is selected).

HTML-Thymeleaf code also:
- chooses different color for list items with sequential even number;
- shows optional way of displaying checkboxes in table form.
